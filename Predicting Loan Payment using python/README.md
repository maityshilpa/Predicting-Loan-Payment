A quick revision of Machine Learning with Python during COVID-19 

This repository contains Project: Predicting Loan Payment-the solution codes of Peer-graded Assignment: The best classifier as a notebook of the course assessments done by me(Shilpa Maity).

N.B. All the codes were tested and passed on coursera. If you find any error or face any issue, let me know through issue section. There is a chance that they may change or add problems in future. If you don't find any problem solution of Peer-graded Assignment.

Machine Learning with Python by IBM part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate.


Use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

1. k-Nearest Neighbour
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Jaccard index
2. F1-score
3. LogLogass
